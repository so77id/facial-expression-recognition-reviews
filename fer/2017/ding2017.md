### Authors

# Principal Topics
* Fer on images
* Special Transfer learning from FaceNet
* Two stages training

### Datasets
* CK+
* OULU
* SFEW
* TDF

# Resume
The authors propose a two stage trainning method, the first stage is use a Conv2d Network and regugalize that network using pretrained FaceNet, the second stage is add FC layers with random initialization for train the clasification and make a pseudo-transfer learning
instead of classic transfer learning using the weigths as initialization
