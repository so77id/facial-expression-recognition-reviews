# Resume
The idea is based in psychologist and neuroscience, that say the human brain has a facial representation learned for each expression, to recognize what expression the brain is seeing they make a contrast between the learned representation and the input.

This paper based on that idea create a neural network mixture ideas from encoder-decoder and classification.
